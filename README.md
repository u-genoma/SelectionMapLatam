selective pressures# SelectionMapLatam

This repository accompanies the chapter ‚ÄúEvidence and Impact of Natural Selection in Latin American Populations‚Äù from the book Human Genetics in Latin America ‚Äì Latin American Admixture and Human Diseases.

The main goal of this work is to explore how evolutionary pressures have shaped the genetic landscape of Latin American populations, highlighting both the evidence of natural selection and its implications for health and disease.

# Repository Scope

## Map of documented Adaptive Selection in Latin Americans

![Figure 1](Files/Figure_2.1_SelectionMap.png)

A visual representation of the geographic distribution of populations in Latin America that have been under adaptive selection that was detected through genomic scans and selection signatures. This map allows for an intuitive understanding of geographic and population-level patterns.

## Source data

This map was created from a curated data table compiling the genetic loci, populations studied, and associated selective pressures that we identified in the scientific literature by August 2025. This dataset is made available for further analysis and reproducibility [here](SelectionStudies.md).

# Objectives

* Provide open access to the underlying data and visualizations presented in the chapter.
* Support researchers, educators, and students interested in population genetics, admixture, and human evolution in Latin America.
* Highlight the impact of natural selection signals on biomedical and evolutionary studies.
