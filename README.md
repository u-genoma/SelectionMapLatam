# SelectionMapLatam
This repository accompanies the chapter “Signatures of Natural Selection: Evidence and Impact in Latin American Populations” from the book Human Genetics in Latin America – Latin American Admixture and Human Diseases.

The main goal of this work is to explore how evolutionary pressures have shaped the genetic landscape of Latin American populations, highlighting both the evidence of natural selection and its implications for health and disease.

# Repository Scope

## Latin American Map of Selective Pressure
A visual representation of genomic regions under selection across different populations in Latin America. This map allows for an intuitive understanding of geographic and population-level patterns.

## Curated Data Table
A comprehensive table compiling the genetic loci, populations studied, and associated selective pressures. This dataset is the foundation from which the map was built and serves as a resource for further analysis and reproducibility.

# Objectives
* Provide open access to the underlying data and visualizations presented in the chapter.
* Support researchers, educators, and students interested in population genetics, admixture, and human evolution in Latin America.
* Highlight the impact of natural selection signals on biomedical and evolutionary studies.
